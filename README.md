# LeNet-5-TensorFlow
Implement LeNet-5 with TensorFlow, trained and evaluated with MNIST. (MNIST data included in Repository)

## Platform
CPU: i7-8700  
GPU: GTX-1660  
System: Windows 10  
Application: Spyder 3.3.6

## How to use
Run train.py to train the LeNet with MNIST, eval.py to test.

## Files
mnist: MNIST images and labels  
environments.yml: my tensorflow environment for this Repository  
model.py: original and modified LeNet models  
func.py: functions used in train.py and eval.py

## Best results in fifty epochs
training accuracy = 0.997, validation accuracy = 0.991, testing accuracy = 0.991
